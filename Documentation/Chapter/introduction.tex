\section{Introduction}
The cavity subgroup of the quantum optics group lead by T.Eslinger recently created spin- and momentum-correlated atom pairs mediated by a photon-exchange process which is driven by a laser. In this work we simulate squeezing and entanglement criteria of the system. Specifically, we look at relative number squeezing and spin-nematic squeezing. (Motivation for those criterias) Motivatied by an improved experimental setup of the cavity subgroup leading to higher laser powers, we look at the dependence of the squeezing criteria on the laser drive strength.
