\section{Relative number squeezing}\label{sec:relative_number_squeezing}
In this chapter we want to observe the dependence of relative number squeezing in our system on different parameters. We look at different detunings $\delta_+$ (\ref{eq:fou_def_delta_p}). To vary this quantity we will look at changes of $\omega_c$ for constant $\omega_d$ and $\omega_z$. Discuss at some point, whether this is proof of entanglement.
We leave $\chi_+$ constant. (\ref{eq:fou_coupling}) and (\ref{eq:fou_decay}) give us the following relations
\begin{align}
	\eta = \sqrt{\frac{\chi}{3}}
	\\
	2
\end{align}
