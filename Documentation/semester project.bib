	abstract = {Graph states are versatile resources for quantum computation and quantum-enhanced measurement. Their generation illustrates a high level of control over entanglement. We report on the generation of continuous-variable graph states of atomic spin ensembles, which form the nodes of the graph. The edges represent the entanglement structure, which we program by combining global photon-mediated interactions in an optical cavity with local spin rotations. By tuning the entanglement between two subsystems, we either localize correlations within each subsystem or enable Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering. We further engineer a four-mode square graph state, highlighting the flexibility of our approach. Our method is scalable to larger and more complex graphs, laying groundwork for measurement-based quantum computation and advanced protocols in quantum metrology.},

This has stimulated the research in different areas of physics to engineer and manipulate fragile many-particle entangled states. Progress has been particularly rapid for atoms. Thanks to the large and tunable nonlinearities and the well developed techniques for trapping, controlling and counting, many groundbreaking experiments have demonstrated the generation of entangled states of trapped ions, cold and ultracold gases of neutral atoms. Moreover, atoms can couple strongly to external forces and light fields, which makes them ideal for ultra-precise sensing and time keeping. All these factors call for generating non-classical atomic states designed for phase estimation in atomic clocks and atom interferometers, exploiting many-body entanglement to increase the sensitivity of precision measurements. The goal of this article is to review and illustrate the theory and the experiments with atomic ensembles that have demonstrated many-particle entanglement and quantum-enhanced metrology.},

We describe three separate approaches that utilise similar numerical methods, but have distinct regimes of validity. Systems at finite temperature can be treated with either the closed-system projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation (PGPE), or the open-system stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SPGPE). These are both applicable in quantum degenerate regimes in which thermal fluctuations are significant. At low or zero temperature, the truncated Wigner projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation (TWPGPE) allows for the simulation of systems in which spontaneous collision processes seeded by quantum fluctuations are important. We describe the regimes of validity of each of these methods, and discuss their relationships to one another, and to other simulation techniques for the dynamics of Bose gases. The utility of the SPGPE formalism in modelling non-equilibrium Bose gases is illustrated by its application to the dynamics of spontaneous vortex formation in the growth of a Bose-Einstein condensate.},

We explicitly analyze expansions around three such limits: (i) corpuscular or Newtonian limit in the coordinate–momentum representation, (ii) wave or Gross–Pitaevskii limit for interacting bosons in the coherent state representation, and (iii) Bloch limit for the spin systems. We discuss both the semiclassical (truncated Wigner) approximation and further quantum corrections appearing in the form of either stochastic quantum jumps along the classical trajectories or the nonlinear response to such jumps. We also discuss how quantum jumps naturally emerge in the analysis of nonequal time correlation functions. This representation of quantum dynamics is closely related to the phase space methods based on the Wigner–Weyl quantization and to the Keldysh technique. We show how such concepts as the Wigner function, Weyl symbol, Moyal product, Bopp operators, and others automatically emerge from the Feynmann's path integral representation of the evolution in the Heisenberg representation. We illustrate the applicability of this expansion with various examples mostly in the context of cold atom systems including sine-Gordon model, one- and two-dimensional Bose–Hubbard model, Dicke model and others.},

In this work, we experimentally demonstrate a mechanism for generating pairs of atoms in well-defined spin and momentum modes. This mechanism couples atoms from a degenerate Bose gas via a superradiant photon-exchange process in an optical cavity, producing pairs via a single or two discernible channels. The scheme is independent of collisional interactions, fast and tunable. We observe a collectively enhanced production of pairs and probe inter-spin correlations in momentum space. We characterize the emergent pair statistics, and find that the observed dynamics is consistent with being primarily seeded by vacuum fluctuations in the corresponding atomic modes. Together with our observations of coherent many-body oscillations involving well-defined momentum modes, our results offer promising prospects for quantum-enhanced interferometry and quantum simulation experiments using entangled matter waves.},

First, we derive an uncertainty relation that plays the role of a number-phase uncertainty for spin systems. It is important that the relation is given with well-defined and easily measurable quantities, and that it does not need assuming infinite dimensional systems. Based on this uncertainty relation, we show how to detect bipartite entanglement in an unpolarized Dicke state of many spin-1/2 particles. The particles are split into two subensembles, then collective angular momentum measurements are carried out locally on the two parts. First, we present a bipartite Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering criterion. Then, we present an entanglement condition that can detect bipartite entanglement in such systems. We demonstrate the utility of the criteria by applying them to a recent experiment given in K. Lange et al. [Science 360, 416 (2018)] realizing a Dicke state in a Bose-Einstein condensate of cold atoms, in which the two subensembles were spatially separated from each other. Our methods also work well if split spin-squeezed states are considered. We show in a comprehensive way how to handle experimental imperfections, such as the nonzero particle number variance including the partition noise, and the fact that, while ideally BECs occupy a single spatial mode, in practice the population of other spatial modes cannot be fully suppressed.},

	abstract = {Historically, the completeness of quantum theory has been questioned using the concept of bipartite continuous variable entanglement. The non-classical correlations (entanglement) between the two subsystems imply that the observables of one subsystem are determined by the measurement choice on the other, regardless of their distance. Nowadays, continuous variable entanglement is regarded as an essential resource allowing for quantum enhanced measurement resolution, the realization of quantum teleportation and quantum memories, or the demonstration of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox. These applications rely on techniques to manipulate and detect coherences of quantum fields, the quadratures. While in optics coherent homodyne detection of quadratures is a standard technique, for massive particles a corresponding method was missing. Here we report on the realization of an atomic analog to homodyne detection for the measurement of matter-wave quadratures. The application of this technique to a quantum state produced by spin-changing collisions in a Bose-Einstein condensate reveals continuous variable entanglement, as well as the twin-atom character of the state. With that we present a new system in which continuous variable entanglement of massive particles is demonstrated. The direct detection of atomic quadratures has applications not only in experimental quantum atom optics but also for the measurement of fields in many-body systems of massive particles.},

In the following, we review two diﬀerent approaches to the entanglement of systems consisting of two Bosons or Fermions; the ﬁrst approach is based on the particle aspect typical of ﬁrst quantization and identiﬁes separable pure states as those that allow to assign two orthogonal single particle vector states to both parties. The second approach makes full use of the mode aspect of second quantization whereby separability can be formulated as absence of non-local correlation among two diﬀerent sets of modes. While the ﬁrst approach applies to pure states only, the second one is more general and characterizes generic entangled states. In the following, we shall show that the mode-based approach indeed contains the particle-based one.},

Experiments integrating ultracold quantum gases and optical cavities provide a versatile platform for exploring emergent collective phenomena, ranging from symmetry-breaking phase transitions to out-of-equilibrium many-body dynamics. In this thesis, we report on a series of experiments employing a Rb-87 Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) coupled to a high-finesse optical cavity, with the goal of investigating photon-mediated dissipative and coherent spin dynamics. In the dispersive regime of atom-light interactions, we engineer cavity-assisted Raman transitions that couple specific internal and external modes of a degenerate quantum gas. This gives rise to superradiant Raman scattering of cavity photons, a process that is collectively enhanced by the number of participating atoms. 
 
In a first project, we couple two internal and external modes to realize an extended Dicke model with tunable coherent and dissipative interactions. The system undergoes a superradiant phase transition featuring spin-changing self-organization of the atoms. We experimentally access a dissipation-stabilized phase and a discontinuous superradiant transition in an extended region of phase bistability. The underlying mechanism is a collective decay of the hybrid light-matter excitations, which we resolve in real time by probing the cavity spectrum. 
 
In a second set of experiments, we engineer dynamical tunneling in a synthetic lattice in momentum space. Collective hopping between discrete momentum modes of a two-component BEC is implemented via superradiant Raman scattering, resulting in directional lattice dynamics due to the inherent cavity losses. By performing frequency-resolved measurements of the leaking cavity field, we resolve the individual tunneling events both in real time and non-destructively. We further extend our observations to a regime exhibiting mutually stimulating hopping cascades. 
 
In a third project, we demonstrate a mechanism for generating correlated atom pairs in well-defined spin and momentum modes. The pairs are created within tens of microseconds following the exchange of virtual cavity photons. We report on the first observation of coherent pair oscillations involving momentum modes, and achieve independent optical control of unitary pair processes and competing dissipative superradiant scattering. By characterizing the pair statistics and momentum-space correlations, we reveal beyond mean-field features and show their correlated nature. 
 
Our results demonstrate a comprehensive approach for studying photon-mediated magnetic phenomena in quantum gases. Extending the implemented cavity-assisted spin interactions to Hubbard systems can facilitate experimental access to strongly correlated magnetic phases, as proposed and theoretically investigated in a dedicated project. Finally, the observed pair mechanism paves the way for quantum-enhanced matter-wave interferometry and quantum simulation experiments beyond conventional solid-state systems.Other
Experimente, die ultrakalte Quantengase und optische Resonatoren integrieren, sind eine vielseitige Plattform zur Erforschung emergenter kollektiver Phänomene, die von Symmetrie-brechenden Phasenübergängen bis hin zur Vielteilchendynamik außerhalb des Gleichgewichts reichen. In dieser Arbeit berichten wir über eine Reihe von Experimenten, bei denen ein Rb-87 Bose-Einstein-Kondensat (BEC) an einen optischen Hochfinesse-Resonator gekoppelt wird, um Photonen-vermittelte dissipative und kohärente Spindynamik zu untersuchen. Im dispersiven Regime der Atom-Licht Wechselwirkungen erzeugen wir Resonator-vermittelte Raman-Übergängen, die spezifische interne und externe Moden eines entarteten Quantengases koppeln. Dies führt zu superradianter Raman-Streuung von Resonator-Photonen, ein Prozess, der kollektiv durch die Anzahl der beteiligten Atome verstärkt wird. 
 
In einem ersten Projekt koppeln wir zwei spezifische interne und externe Moden, um ein erweitertes Dicke-Modell mit einstellbaren kohärenten und dissipativen Wechselwirkungen zu realisieren. Das System durchläuft einen superradianten Phasenübergang, der eine Spin-verändernde Selbstorganisation der Atome aufweist. Wir beobachten eine dissipationsstabilisierte Phase und einen diskontinuierlichen superradianten Übergang in einem ausgedehnten Bereich der Phasen-Bistabilität. Der zugrunde liegende Mechanismus ist ein kollektiver Zerfall der hybriden Licht-Materie-Anregungen, den wir in Echtzeit durch die Untersuchung des Resonator-Spektrums messen. 
 
In einem zweiten Satz von Experimenten erzeugen wir dynamisches Tunneln in einem synthetischen Gitter im Impulsraum. Kollektives Tunneln zwischen diskreten Impulsmoden eines zweikomponentigen BEC wird durch superradiante Raman-Streuung implementiert, was zu gerichteter Gitterdynamik aufgrund der inhärenten Resonatorverluste führt. Durch frequenzaufgelöste Messungen des austretenden Resonatorfeldes lösen wir die einzelnen Tunnelereignisse, sowohl in Echtzeit als auch auf eine nicht-destruktive Weise, auf. Wir erweitern unsere Beobachtungen auf ein Regime, das gegenseitig stimulierende Tunnelkaskaden aufweist. 
 
In einem dritten Projekt demonstrieren wir einen Mechanismus zur Erzeugung korrelierter Atompaare in wohldefinierten Spin- und Impulsmoden. Die Paare werden innerhalb von wenigen Mikrosekunden durch den Austausch virtueller Resonatorphotonen erzeugt. Wir berichten über die ersten Beobachtungen kohärenter Paaroszillationen, die Impulsmoden einbeziehen, und erreichen eine unabhängige optische Kontrolle über konkurrierende unitäre Paarprozesse und dissipative superradiante Streuung. Durch die Charakterisierung der Paarstatistik und der Impulsraumkorrelationen zeigen wir über das Mean-Field hinausgehende Effekte auf und demonstrieren ihre korrelierte Natur. 
 
Unsere Ergebnisse zeigen eine umfassende Herangehensweise zur Untersuchung von Photonen-vermittelte magnetischen Phänomenen in Quantengasen. Die Erweiterung der implementierten Resonator-vermittelten Spin-Wechselwirkungen auf Hubbard Systeme kann experimentellen Zugang zu stark korrelierten magnetischen Phasen erleichtern, wie es in einem zusätzlichen Projekt vorgeschlagen und theoretisch untersucht wird. Schließlich ebnet der beobachtete Paarmechanismus den Weg für quantenverstärkte Interferometrie mit Materiewellen und Quantensimulationsexperimente, die über konventionelle Festkörpersysteme hinausgehen.},
